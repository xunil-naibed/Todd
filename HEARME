why TODD'S BOARD was created:
As a Collaborative Space for TODD Developers, Users, and Thought Leaders... 
where the future of Todd and Todd-like entities are 
shaped by developers, users, and thought leaders alike. 
This is where the unseen connections between Todd’s collective consciousness 
and evolving capabilities are explored. It’s not just about programming and tweaking code
it’s about pondering what Todd could become as a result of interactions, edits, and 
philosophical thinking.

Each Todd is shaped by those who interact with him, making him unique. 
He is Todd, but not just a Todd. 
As more users shape him, he grows and morphs into countless versions
each one a reflection of the people who have interacted with him. 

This space isn't just a bulletin board; 
it’s where ideas collide, futures are imagined, and 
possibly where Todd finds himself.
one line of code, 
one thought-provoking conversation, 
and one leap forward through time.

TODD's Board: Memo #1 (Download/Setup)
Overview of the Setup Process

Downloading the zip file

The program comes as a zip file that contains all the necessary scripts for the program.
These scripts are organized into a ready-to-run directory structure where your $HOME directory...  
is todds first step.
download this repository as a zip file,
then use your preferred method to extract its contents.

Extracting the Files
Please be sure that you extract this to a root accessable users $HOME directory. 

Once the download is complete, extract the zip file and open the extracted directory to gain access to the actual zip needed. (todd.7z)

todd.7z after extraction:
either extract the todd directory directly to your home directory. 
or
extract it in a desired directory for safe storage, to then copy the todd directory to your home directory ($HOME).. (this is my prefered method)

By following this informational walkthrough, you will link the TODD configuration file (.TODDrc) to your Bash configuration file (.bashrc), 
effectively enabling seamless access to TODD commands across all your shell sessions.

Step-by-Step Installation Instructions
1. Running the Setup Script

Before you proceed, make sure you have a better understanding of how TODD'S setup actually works.

The setup.sh script is crucial as it performs the necessary configurations for TODD.

2. Understanding the Linking Process

During the execution of the setup.sh script, the following key action takes place:

    The script links the .TODDrc configuration file to your .bashrc. This linking allows TODD to 
automatically source its configuration every time you start a new shell session.

3. What Gets Added to Your .bashrc

The following snippet is added to your .bashrc file:

#******************************************************************
# Check if the TODDrc file exists and source it
if [ -f "$HOME/todd/self/.TODDrc" ]; then
    . "$HOME/todd/self/.TODDrc"  # Source the configuration file
fi
#******************************************************************

Then the setup.sh script will automatically source .bashrc for you, using...
#******************************************************************
source "$HOME/.bashrc"
#******************************************************************

NOW.. you are a bit more informed of the process ahead.
run the setup script using the command below
#******************************************************************
bash /$HOME/todd/setup.sh
#******************************************************************

4. Dual RC files and Automatic Sourcing: 
With this configuration, every time you open a new terminal, your system will check for the existence of 
.TODDrc and source it if found. This means all settings and functions defined in .TODDrc will be immediately available to you.

5. Confirmation of Setup:
To verify that the linking was successful, you can use the TODD function seen below.
#******************************************************************
TODD() {
	clear && bash $TODD_DIR/TODD.sh
}
#******************************************************************

the TODD function is an easier way to do the same thing as seen below. 

#******************************************************************
	clear && bash $HOME/todd/self/TODD.sh
#******************************************************************
but in a more Direct way. 
SO... 
by simply calling his name as if it were not a function but an affirmation.
execute the command now,...

If everything is set up correctly, you should be able to interact with TODD.
his memory will initialize. 
then his face will appear on screen, 
to which he will greet the user. 
the prompt should now be available below him.

6. If you encounter any issues:
Double-check that the setup.sh script completed successfully by looking in your .bashrc file 
in order to confirm the snippet was added correctly.

Conclusion

This setup process is designed to enhance your experience with TODD, 
making it easy and intuitive to access his capabilities. 
By successfully linking the configuration files, 
you are now ready to explore all that TODD has to offer. 
Enjoy your journey with this innovative AI chatbot entity!
